This website was created as part of a classroom project to demonstrate the structure and conceptual potential of a commercial plumbing repair site. It is designed solely for academic evaluation and remains private, accessible only to the course instructor and a peer reviewer.
Very limited content has been referenced from Plumbing: A Homeownerâ€™s Guide by Steve Cory, published by Taunton Press (USA, 2016, ISBN: 10987654321). A total of four pages from the 214-page book were used as sources, focusing on essential repair and installation methods. All referenced material has been rephrased and adapted for educational purposes and incorporated in a transformative manner.
Specific references include:
â€¢	Kitchen Repairs: Page 157 â€” rephrased instructions for installing an under-the-sink water filter, with one image from the book used for illustration.
â€¢	Bathroom Toilet Repairs: 
o	Example 1: Diagnosing and replacing a faulty flapper in a leaking toilet bowl.
o	Example 2: Identifying and correcting a continuous water flow issue by replacing the water control mechanism.
o	Two images from the book were used to support these explanations.
All additional photographs throughout the website are original and owned by the creator. The use of content from the referenced book falls under fair use, as it serves a non-commercial, educational purpose, includes minimal material relative to the original work, and does not substitute or compete with the original publication.
